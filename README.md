## 🌐 Multilingual Management and Translation

Is your site available in multiple languages? You can translate the text you enter in the widget's options (like the "
Button Text" or "Popup Text") using a multilingual plugin.

The plugin is compatible with the most popular extensions like **WPML** or **Polylang**.

### How to translate the widget's content?

1. **Install and configure a multilingual plugin** (e.g., WPML or Polylang) on your site.

2. **Enter the default text:**
    * Go to **Settings > Virage AI Chat**.
    * Fill in the text fields (e.g., `Button Text`, `Popup WhatsApp Text`) in your site's primary language.
    * Click **Save Changes**. This action saves your text and makes it available for translation.

3. **Translate the text strings:**
    * Go to your multilingual plugin's translation interface (e.g., **WPML > String Translation** or **Languages >
      String Translations** for Polylang).
    * Search for the text strings using the `Virage AI Chat Widget` domain.
    * You will find all the text you entered in the previous step.
    * Add the translations for each language configured on your site.

Once these steps are completed, the widget will automatically display the text in the correct language based on the
language chosen by the visitor.
